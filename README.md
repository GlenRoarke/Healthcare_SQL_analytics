# Healthcare Analytics SQL

## Authors
Glen Roarke

## Description

This is a storage of some health analytics SQL code I have used last year within the NHS. The majority of this code was visualised using SSRS and power BI type programs. 
Systems used are PAS, Maternity, and Pharmacy here.

There is a strong data quality focus here to improve the commission data set (CDS), implement new PAS merger requirements and SPINE intergration.

## Future additions
Hoping to add some SSIS package examples for ETL processes I used to manage, if I can obtain them.
